# Modular Chamber for Satellite 1 by FutureProofHomes.

This is based on the original design by FutureProofHomes https://github.com/FutureProofHomes/Satellite1-Enclosures and their great team.  

Version 2.

This enclosure uses heated inserts to hold it together.  It also has as air chambers, TPU buffers and TPU grommets.  The air chambers can have foam added to help seperate the sound from the body and the UPO.

More detail documentation will be added.

The disassembly document show how the enclosure is put together. 

The enclosure-v3.3mf has all the parts needed to print.  The heat inserts are M3x5x4 and M3x10 screws (socket or button head will work).  There are 4 of each needed for each enclosure part (top, air chamber, and body)
